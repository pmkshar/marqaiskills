## Methodology

### Definitions

- **TAM (Total Addressable Market)**: The total revenue opportunity if 100% of the target market adopted the product/service. Represents the theoretical maximum.
- **SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)**: The portion of TAM that the company can realistically target given its business model, geography, go-to-market strategy, and product capabilities.
- **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)**: The portion of SAM the company can realistically capture in a defined timeframe, accounting for competition, resources, and execution capability.

### Approach

This analysis uses both top-down and bottom-up methodologies, then triangulates to produce a best estimate.

[Describe the specific approach taken for this analysis]

---

## Top-Down Analysis

### Step 1: Total Industry Market

[Source data, citation, and the broadest market number]

### Step 2: Geographic Adjustment

[How the geography filter was applied, with rationale and source]

### Step 3: Segment Adjustment

[How the target segment filter was applied, with rationale and source]

### Step 4: Product-Fit Adjustment

[How the product-specific filter was applied, with rationale]

### Top-Down Results

| Metric | Value | Calculation |
|---|---|---|
| TAM | $X | [show math] |
| SAM | $X | [show math] |
| SOM | $X | [show math] |

---

## Bottom-Up Analysis

### Customer Count Estimation

[How many potential customers exist, by segment, with sources]

### Revenue Per Customer Estimation

[ACV/ARPU analysis from pricing benchmarks and competitor data]

### Bottom-Up Results

| Metric | Value | Calculation |
|---|---|---|
| TAM | $X | [show math] |
| SAM | $X | [show math] |
| SOM | $X | [show math] |

## Triangulation and Best Estimate

[Compare top-down and bottom-up. Explain any divergence. Present the best estimate with rationale for weighting.]
