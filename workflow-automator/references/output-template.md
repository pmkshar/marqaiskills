# Output Document Template

Generate a file called `workflow-automation.md` in the current working directory with the structure below. The document must be comprehensive and actionable -- self-contained enough that someone could implement the automation from it alone. Target 500+ lines of substantive content. Never produce a summary or abbreviated version.

## Executive Summary

[2-3 paragraph overview: what the workflow does today, what problems exist,
what the automated version will achieve, and projected time savings.
Include a single key metric: "This automation will save approximately
X hours per week / reduce processing time from Y to Z / eliminate N%
of manual errors."]

     - Rectangles for actions
     - Diamonds for decisions
     - Parallelograms for inputs/outputs
     - Circles for start/end
     Use color coding:
     - style nodeX fill:#ff9999 for bottlenecks

    [Complete Mermaid diagram of the automated workflow.
     Include triggers, automated actions, decision gates,
     parallel paths, human checkpoints, and error handlers.
     Use color coding:
     - style nodeX fill:#4CAF50,color:#fff for fully automated steps
     - style nodeX fill:#2196F3,color:#fff for API integrations
     - style nodeX fill:#FF9800,color:#fff for human-in-the-loop

## 5. Implementation Plan

### 5.1 Phases

[Break implementation into phases. Phase 1 should deliver value
within 1-2 weeks. Later phases add complexity.]

**Phase 1: Quick Wins (Week 1-2)**
- [Highest-impact, lowest-risk automations]
- [Expected time savings from Phase 1 alone]

**Phase 2: Core Automation (Week 3-4)**
- [Main workflow logic and integrations]
- [Cumulative time savings]

**Phase 3: Error Handling and Edge Cases (Week 5-6)**
- [Robust error handling, monitoring, edge case coverage]
- [Reliability improvements]

**Phase 4: Optimization and Monitoring (Week 7-8)**
- [Performance tuning, dashboards, alerting]
- [Long-term maintainability]

### 5.2 Prerequisites

[What needs to be in place before implementation:
API access, credentials, accounts, permissions, data cleanup]

### 5.3 Testing Strategy

[How to test each phase before going live:
parallel run with manual process, staged rollout,
canary testing, rollback plan]

### 5.4 Migration Plan

[How to transition from manual to automated:
parallel running period, cutover criteria, rollback triggers]

### 5.5 Risk Register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
[Risks specific to this automation project]

## 6. Impact Assessment

### 6.1 Time Savings

| Step | Current Time (manual) | Automated Time | Savings per Run | Monthly Savings |
|------|-----------------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
[Detailed time savings for each step]

**Total Monthly Time Savings: [X hours]**
**Annual Time Savings: [X hours] ([X FTE equivalent])**

### 6.2 Error Reduction

[Quantified reduction in errors at each step]

### 6.3 Throughput Improvement

[How many more items per day/week the workflow can handle]

### 6.4 Cost Analysis

| Item | Monthly Cost |

| Automation platform subscription | $X |
| API/integration costs | $X |
| Hosting (if self-hosted) | $X |
| Maintenance time | $X |
| **Total Automation Cost** | **$X** |
| **Manual Labor Cost Saved** | **$X** |
| **Net Monthly Savings** | **$X** |
| **ROI Period** | **X months** |

### 6.5 Qualitative Benefits

## 7. Maintenance and Monitoring

### 7.1 Monitoring Dashboard
